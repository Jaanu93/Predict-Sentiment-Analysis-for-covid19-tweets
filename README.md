# Predict-Sentiment-Analysis-for-covid19-tweets
My first repository on GitHub.
The repository contains an ongoing collection of tweets IDs associated with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), which commenced on January 28, 2020. We used the Twitter’s search API to gather historical Tweets from the preceding 7 days. We leveraged Twitter’s streaming API to follow specified accounts and also collect in real-time tweets that mention specific keywords.
